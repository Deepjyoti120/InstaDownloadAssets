1. yes, i use this logo design for my reference only.
I do not use this logo directly and do not customize it.
2. I download this logo .zip file from freepik and I have permission to use this logo on my app or any other platform.

3. i use png/jpg and build my own customize icon using Adobe XD, i do not use any .esp format. also i use my own colour .
