Well. thank you for Suspended this app from play-store. 
this may be my mistake and I follow your term and condition also accepted before submitting this app on play-store.

After reading clarification that clearly mentions "Insta" word which is similar to Instagram why because its an Instagram downloader app and I use public api, but also mention color or graphics. this is not accepted. why because I do not use any color inspect tools to build my logo or play-store graphics. 
I use Adobe XD and I pick up Some Random Color using XD gradient color fill section. I am UI/UX Designer so I know which color is good for users to attract or create an eye-catching logo/Design.
Please check my XD Design: - https://xd.adobe.com/view/8514c3d6-cbf6-4827-ac8d-4ac56972f1dd-d047/ 
it its possible i am ready to change everything from my app with logo, name, etc.
please do not do this I will fix all issues because I invest lots of my working time to build this app/logo.
